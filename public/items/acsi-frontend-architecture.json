  "description": "During 2018 I started to redefine the frontend architecture of ACSI. The site was too tightly coupled to jQuery, plugins and Compass. I removed the dependency on Compass. Replaced Assetic for Webpack, and moved all to legacy code to a seperate (readonly) folder. After a discussion with the team we to make three script build-lanes for the current sites: Legacy, ES6  and React. After that we began to fill to Jest unit-tested repositories acsi-frontent (ES6) and acsi-react, which would be consumed by the site specific ES6/React code.",
